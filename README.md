# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Ashkan!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm currently on an exciting journey learning **Dart** with the goal of building amazing applications using the **Flutter** framework.

* ðŸŒ± **What I'm Learning:** Right now, my focus is purely on understanding the core concepts and syntax of the **Dart** language. Flutter is next on my list!
* ðŸŽ¯ **My Goal:** To become proficient in creating smooth, responsive, and user-friendly mobile apps for both iOS and Android.
* âš¡ **Fun Fact:** It's like my brain has a fast-track for tech! When friends or teachers explain science or IT concepts, I usually grasp them on the very first try. It's a favorite talent of mine!

Feel free to look around, though most repositories might be related to my learning process for now!
