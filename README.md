ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Ashkan!

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm currently focused on learning Dart for Flutter development.

ðŸŒ± What I'm Learning
Currently, my main focus is on understanding the core concepts and syntax of the Dart language. Flutter is next on my learning list!

ðŸŽ¯ My Goal
My goal is to become proficient in creating smooth, responsive, and user-friendly mobile apps for both iOS and Android.

âš¡ Fun Fact
It's like my brain has a fast-track for tech! When friends or teachers explain science or IT concepts, I usually grasp them on the very first try. It's a favorite talent of mine!

Feel free to look around, though most repositories might be related to my learning process for now!
